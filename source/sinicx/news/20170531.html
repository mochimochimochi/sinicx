              <p>OMRON VENTURES Co., Ltd. (Chief Executive Officer: Naoshi Ozawa) announced that it has invested in Vegetalia, Inc. (Headquarters: Shibuya, Tokyo; Chief Executive Officer: Satoshi Koike, hereinafter referred to as "Vegetalia"), a company involved in developing the agricultural IoT business.</p>

              <p>Vegetalia aims to bring about a "next generation green revolution" for agricultural production by making full use of the latest vegetation science and technology. By redesigning production, distribution, and logistics supply chains, they seek to provide solutions that will lead to improvements in agricultural productivity and quality through the fusion of agriculture and IT, realizing a sustainable environment and a healthy society.</p>

              <p>Vegetalia's agricultural sensor technology is saving labor when it comes to water supply management of paddy fields and dry-field farming.<br>
                Their pest and disease damage prevention technology is undergoing systemization based on joint research between the Laboratory of Plant Pathology at the Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Tokyo, as well as using the company's sensor data analysis / AI technology together with the Vegetalia Plant Hospital™, operated by expert qualified botanical doctors. This is leading to the possibility of automating measures against agricultural crop diseases and pests.<br>
                By utilizing their agricultural sensor technology and know-how together with OMRON's "Sensing & Control + Think" technology, we aim to build differentiated technologies and see the realization of automated agribusiness that can provide value to a wide range of customers.</p>

              <p>OMRON VENTURES Co., Ltd. will continue to support enterprises that create new added value through OMRON's own "Sensing & Control + Think" technology and investment activities, actively engaging in collaborations with promising companies, and contributing to resolving various societal issues.</p>
